I’m Tyler, a computer science student based in Utah. I like building clean, structured applications, solving logical problems, and turning ideas into working software.

**These days I’m focused on:**

* Java & Object-Oriented Programming
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* Building small but polished projects
* Strengthening backend fundamentals

**Some stuff I built:**

* [Java Image Processor](https://github.com/tylertmd/ImageProcessor) – A GUI-based image filtering app with custom filters like sepia, red-blue swap, and gradients built using 2D pixel manipulation.
* [Sound Sketcher](https://github.com/tylertmd/SoundSketcher) – A Java GUI application for composing multi-track music using programmable notes and instrument mappings. Implemented track layering, timing control, and structured OOP design to manage audio generation and dynamic playback.
