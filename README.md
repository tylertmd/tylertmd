I’m Tyler, a computer science student based in Utah. I like building clean, structured applications, solving logical problems, and turning ideas into working software.

**These days I’m focused on:**

* Java & Object-Oriented Programming
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* Building small but polished projects
* Strengthening backend fundamentals

**Some stuff I built:**

* Java Image Processor – A GUI-based image filtering app with custom filters like sepia, red-blue swap, and gradients built using 2D pixel manipulation.
* Filter Engine – Custom image transformations implemented from scratch focusing on clean logic and efficiency.
* Command-Line Utilities – Small Python programs focused on problem solving and algorithmic thinking.
* Portfolio Projects – Ongoing builds designed to sharpen real-world development skills.
